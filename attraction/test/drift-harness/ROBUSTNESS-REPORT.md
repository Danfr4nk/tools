# Pose-robustness ranking — Telemetry Lab

Generated 2026-09-14T03:54:22.576Z.

## Inputs
- 22 within-face pairs: 21 from the 7-capture same-face series (face A), 1 from the
  2-capture series (face B). All captures low quality; yaw span up to 62° — a
  DETECTOR STRESS TEST, not a normal reliability trial.
- 155 frozen bank faces (synthetic baseline) for between-face SD.
- Synthetic probe: rigid 3D rotations of each bank face (±5/10/15/20° yaw,
  ±5/10° roll, ±5/10° pitch), re-run through computeTelemetry. Pure geometric
  pose sensitivity — no detector in the loop. z-depths are approximate
  (MediaPipe-normalized), so 3D rotations are indicative, not exact.

## Two regimes — read both
**Geometric (synthetic):** how the metric's MATH responds to pose. The causal,
calibrated quantity; basis of the per-metric flags in js/robustness.js. A flag
is a LOWER bound on the doubt ("geometry alone already corrupts this by ~X SD")
— never a clean bill of health.

**Detector-in-the-loop (empirical):** what actually happened on the stress-test
captures, detector noise and occlusion included. At extreme pose the detector
breakdown DOMINATES: no per-metric flag can be calibrated there, and the
quality gate (low quality / low frontality) is the defense — it already fires
on all 9 captures. Where empirical >> synthetic, the detector (not the
geometry) is the failure.

Radii are synthetic worst-axis: degrees of that axis at which the metric is
expected to move 1 bank SD. Tier: robust ≥20° · moderate 10–20° · fragile <10°.

## 2026-09-14 bug caught by this analysis
The synthetic sweep found the lab's canthal-tilt roll correction had the wrong
sign on the image-left eye (+roll added to both eyes corrected R and DOUBLED
the contamination on L — tiltL moved +10° per +10° imposed roll). Fixed in
js/telemetry.js (L: −roll, R: +roll); both eyes verified bit-invariant under
±10° imposed roll. The game's measure.js tilt is uncorrected (pre-existing,
not a bug — out of scope).

## Headline findings
- Asymmetry metrics (mean_asymmetry, asymmetry_9, gonial_diff) are the most
  pose-sensitive anatomy metrics — expected, since asymmetry itself is
  pose-contaminated. asymmetry_9 stays uncorrected by design; its flag now
  says so explicitly.
- Roll-corrected canthal tilt is roll-invariant by construction (verified),
  with residual pitch sensitivity (~0.2 SD/°); canthal_tilt_diff is robust.
- Jaw/cheek/mouth width ratios (jaw_to_cheek, mouth_to_cheek, mouth_to_nose,
  canon_nose) are geometrically near-invariant to pose — the earlier jaw-soft
  adiposity confound is a shape effect, not a pose artifact.
- eye_w_to_h has genuine yaw sensitivity (0.08 SD/°): at |yaw| > ~12° the
  denominator collapses and the ratio explodes (the 23.695 capture) — capped
  and flagged, not trusted.
- In the empirical stress test, detector noise at extreme pose moves most
  metrics ≥1 SD regardless of geometric tier. Per-metric flags do not cover
  this regime; the quality gate does.

## Flagging rule (implemented in the lab)
For a capture at pose (yaw, roll, pitch): expected deviation (bank SD) =
Σ slope_axis × |angle_axis| (linearized worst case, synthetic slopes).
≥0.5 → `pose-suspect`; ≥1.0 → `pose-unreliable`. Pose metrics excluded
(flagging pose for pose is circular); asymmetry_9 flagged, not corrected.
